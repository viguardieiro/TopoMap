# TopoMap

Python version of the dimensionality reduction technique called TopoMap. The original version (made in C++), is available [here](https://github.com/harishd10/TopoMap).

The technique is outlined in the paper:

This version was implemented with Python 3.11.7 and all packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
